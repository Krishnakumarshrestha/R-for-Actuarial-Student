    "text": "1.2 What is a Script ?\nif you are new to programming, you may be wondering what a script is. In programming, a script is a set of instructions that a computer can follow. Scripts can be used to automate tasks perform calculations, manupulate data, and more.\nIn R, a script is a text file that contains R code. You can create a new script in RStudio by going to File> New File > R Script. This will open a new window where you can write your code.\nOne of the advantages of using a script is that it allows you to save your code so that you can reuse it later. You can also edit and modify your code as needed. Another advantage of using a script is that it allows you to document your code. You can add comments to your code to explain what each section of code does.\nWhen you run a script in RStudio,the code is executed line by line. The output of each line of code is displayed in the console, which is a window in RStudio that displays the results of your code. You can also view the output of your script in the environment pane, which displays objects that are created by your code."

    "section": "2.2 Operators",
    "text": "2.2 Operators\nOperators are symbols or functions used to perform operations on values or variables in R. They are an essential part of programming in R, and allow you to perform a wide range of mathematical and logical operations. In this chapter, we’ll cover the basics of operators in R, including arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.\n\n2.2.1 Arithmetic operators\nArithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on values in R. The most common arithmetic operators in R are:\n\n+: Addition\n-: Subtraction\n*: Multiplication\n/: Division\n^: Exponentiation\n%%: Modulus\n%/%: Integer division\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Comparison Operators\nComparison operators are used to compare values in R. They return a Boolean value (TRUE or FALSE) based on whether the comparison is true or false. The most common comparison operators in R are:\n\n==: Equal to\n!=: Not equal to\n<: Less than\n>: Greater than\n<=: Less than or equal to\n>=: Greater than or equal to\n\nfor example, to compare two values in R:\n\n2 > 3\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n3 != 2\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Logical Operators\nLogical operators are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values in R. The most common logical operators in R are:\n\n!: NOT operator\n&: AND operator\n|: OR operator\nxor(): XOR operator\n\nFor example, to perform a logical AND operation on two Boolean values (TRUE and FALSE) in R, you would use the & operator. Here’s an example:\n\nTRUE & FALSE\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nTRUE | FALSE\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Assignment Operator\nThe assignment operator is one of the most fundamental operators in R. It is used to assign a value to a variable or an object. In this chapter, we’ll cover the basics of the assignment operator in R, including its syntax and some best practices.\nIn R, the assignment operator is denoted by <-. It is used to assign a value to a variable or an object. For example, to assign the value 15 to a variable named x, you would use the following code:\n\nx<-15\n\nThis code assigns the value 15 to a variable name x.\nThe <- operator is the traditional way of assigning values to variables in R, while = is a more recent addition to the language and is used as an alternative to <-. Both operators can be used interchangeably for most purposes, but there are some differences in how they are parsed by R.\n\n\n2.2.5 Comment in R\nIn R, the comment operator is denoted by the # symbol. It is used to add comments to your code, which are ignored by R when it executes your program.\nComments are useful for providing additional information about your code or explaining your thought process to other programmers who may be reading your code.\nHere’s an example :\n\n# First lets create a variable x and store 25\nx <- 25 # here x is my variable name, <- is the assignment operator and 25 is the value i need to store\n\n\n\n2.2.6 Exercise\n\nCreate a variable called x and assign it the value 5. Then, use the == operator to check if x is equal to 5. Store the result in a new variable called a.\nWrite an expression that uses the != operator to check if x is not equal to 4. Store the result in a new variable called b.\nCreate a variable called y and assign it the value 10. Then, use the > operator to check if y is greater than x. Store the result in a new variable called c.\nWrite an expression that uses the < operator to check if y is less than or equal to 10. Store the result in a new variable called d.\nCreate a variable called z and assign it the value 15. Then, use the >= operator to check if z is greater than or equal to y. Store the result in a new variable called e.\nWrite an expression that uses the <= operator to check if x is less than or equal to 5. Store the result in a new variable called f.\nCreate a variable called a1 and assign it the value TRUE. Then, use the && operator to check if a1 is TRUE and if b (from exercise 2) is TRUE. Store the result in a new variable called g.\nWrite an expression that uses the || operator to check if either c (from exercise 3) is TRUE or d (from exercise 4) is FALSE. Store the result in a new variable called h.\nCreate a variable called i and assign it the value \"apple\". Then, use the %in% operator to check if \"apple\" is in the vector c(\"orange\", \"banana\", \"apple\", \"grape\"). Store the result in a new variable called j.\nWrite an expression that uses the %/% operator to find the integer quotient when z (from exercise 5) is divided by 3. Store the result in a new variable called k."
